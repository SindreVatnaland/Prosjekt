# My projects

## 1# Sudoku:  
Sudoku with 3 difficulties  
Play by entering x/y coordinates and a value (0-9).

## 2# Flappy Bird  
A recreation of Flappy Bird in PyGame.

## 3# Tower Defense  
Tower Defense game inspired by Bloons  
Attack incoming enemies by clicking on them or by placing turrets nearby.  
Defeating enemies and completing waves grants you coins.  
Each wave gets progressively more difficult.  
(Little to no models and no attack animation - black borders).

## 4# Item counting  
An web-app developed for my current job.  
Its purpose is to make item counting more intuitive. 
This by making it possible to register items with your phone, using a bluetooth barcode scanner, 
rather than bringing item to the counter physically.  
Detailed readme in the "Item count" folder.
